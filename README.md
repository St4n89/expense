Expenses counter scenario

This program reads data from CSVs provided by banks and transforms the content into a form which can be added into my expenses log on Google Sheets.

The categorisation of purchases is done through dictionary files containing store names. These list are contionously updated.

Now working with Alfabank and Citibank csv reports. Support for SMS logs may (or not) be added later.
