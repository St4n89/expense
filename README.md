Expenses counter scenario

This program reads data from CSVs provided by banks and transforms the content into a form which can be added into my expenses log on Google Sheets.

The categorisation of purchase records is done through a number of dictionary files containing store names. These lists are contionously updated.

Now working with Alfabank and Citibank csv reports. Support for SMS logs may (or not) be added later.
